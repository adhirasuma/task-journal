## 🌈 Hello coders 👋  

Welcome to this little corner of code ✨  
This Todo List app started as a simple idea — just managing tasks — and slowly grew into a full-stack project with authentication, API calls, and real-world logic.

If you're exploring React, Django, or just love building things step by step, you're going to enjoy this 💫

A full-stack Todo List application built with:  

🎨 **React** (frontend)  
⚙️ **Django REST Framework** (backend)  

It lets users securely manage their tasks with authentication and smooth API interaction 🌿

## 💬 Final Thought  

This project may look simple, but it carries a lot of learning behind it — from basic CRUD to handling authentication flows.  
Always learning, always improving  🚀
