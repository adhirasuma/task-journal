## 🌈 Hello Coders 👋

Welcome to **Task Journal** ✨

What started as a simple Todo List gradually evolved into a full-stack web application with authentication, API integration, responsive design, theme customization, and smooth animations.

Instead of creating another generic task manager, I wanted something that felt more personal—a digital notebook where tasks could be managed in a clean and minimal journal-like interface 📖.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Task Journal is a full-stack application built using:

🎨 **React.js** for the frontend

⚙️ **Django REST Framework** for the backend

The application allows users to securely create, update, and manage their daily tasks with JWT authentication and a notebook-inspired user experience.

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

npm install

npm start
```

Create a `.env` file inside the frontend folder:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```text
Login
   │
   ▼
Receive Access & Refresh Tokens
   │
   ▼
API Requests use Access Token
   │
   ▼
Token Expired?
   │
  Yes
   │
   ▼
Axios Interceptor Refreshes Token
   │
   ▼
Continue Request Seamlessly
```

If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the user is automatically logged out.

## 💬 Final Thought

Task Journal may look simple on the surface, but it represents my journey through full-stack development—from building REST APIs and implementing JWT authentication to creating responsive user interfaces and deploying production-ready applications.

Every feature was built step by step, and every challenge became a learning opportunity.

✨ Always learning.
🚀 Always building.
📖 One task at a time.


Welcome to this little corner of code ✨  
This Todo List app started as a simple idea — just managing tasks — and slowly grew into a full-stack project with authentication, API calls, and real-world logic.

If you're exploring React, Django, or just love building things step by step, you're going to enjoy this 💫
